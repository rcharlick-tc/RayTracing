   Description:      This file contains a complete list and brief description of all the files included with this project.


   Batch Files:
      Scene.bat      Used for generating complete set of PCX files.
      Show.bat       Batch file for displaying PCX files.



   Compiler files:
      Render.dsk     Borland C++ file for saving environment information.
      Render.prj     Borland C++ Project file for saving source code and library information.



   Source code files:
      Display.c      Source file for displaying status and information screens.
      Select.c       This file contains source code for the pixel selection routines used in this project.
      Menu.c         Source file for the menu package used throughout this project.
      Eval.c         This file contains the primary menu evaluation routines for this program.
      Render.c       This file contains the main program module as well as many of the project's utility functions.
      Surface.c      This is the source code for the Ray Tracing algorithm, root finding procedures and the illumination model.

         The following files contain constant definitions and function prototypes for their respective namesake C files.  Two 
      additional files Errmsg.h and Globals.h, contain error message definitions, used throughout the project and global 
      definitions used by all of the C files.

      Display.h
      Errmsg.h
      Globals.h
      Menu.h
      Eval.h
      Select.h
      Surface.h
      Render.h



   Documentation files: 
      Data.dct       File containing a description of data structures and variables for each source code file.
      Readme.doc     Documentation describing the setup, configuration and use of this package.
      Render.doc     This documentation describes the function and description of how the program works.
      Packing.lst    This file, containing file descriptions of all files used in this package.



   Executables:   
      Render.exe     The single execuatble file for running this project.



   Data files:
      Image.mnu      Data file containing the image menu configuration of displayable objects.

      Tori.img       An image file containing data for four tori of various dimensions, position and color.
      Generic.img    The image file for defining Dr. Anderson's third degree equation.
      Sphere.img     An image file containing data for a single sphere.
      Spheres.img    An image file containing data for eight spheres of various size, color and position.

      Medley.img     An image file conatining both spheres and tori.

            Below is a list of configuartion files used for demonstrating various visual effects such as rotation, background
         color, source light position, light saturation and center of rotation. 

         Render.cfg     This is the default configuration file.
         Effect01.cfg   Original lighting direction and flooding.
         Effect02.cfg   Variation of lighting direction.
         Effect03.cfg   Variation of lighting direction and saturation.
         Effect04.cfg   Another variation of lighting direction
         Effect05.cfg   Single plane rotation of original image.
         Effect06.cfg   Original lighting with two plane rotation.
         Effect07.cfg   Three plane rotation.
         Effect08.cfg   Original lighting with new back ground color.     



   Picture files:
            Below is a list of output files generated by the scene.bat files using a variety of image files and configuration 
         files.
