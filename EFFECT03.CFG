   This file contains configuration information for running the execuatble
RENDER.EXE.  Do not add or remove lines, as the label positions are required
to be constant.  This file sets the default values to the following variables:

Label   Value       Description
=====   =====       ======================================
SUNX:   -2.5        -Source X position
SUNY:    2.0        -Source Y position
SUNZ:   -3.0        -Source Z position
BCKC:    8          -Background Color
SATA:    100        -Saturation Angles
CHCK:    0          -Enable Root checking (0 = OFF, 1 = ON)
XROT:    0          -Rotation in degrees about the X axis
YROT:    0          -Rotation in degrees about the Y axis
ZROT:    0          -Rotation in degrees about the Z axis
INUM:    1          -The image number in the scene to use as a center for
                     rotation. A value of 0 indicates a rotation on the
                     centroid of the image plane, a value of -1 uses the
                     centroid of the rendering space.

Note:  Each value must have the above required label in order to have the
       desired effect.
